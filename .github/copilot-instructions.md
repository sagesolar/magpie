## Project Summary

The Magpie Book Collection System has been successfully created with full CI/CD pipeline:

### Backend Features

- Clean Architecture with SOLID principles
- Node.js + TypeScript REST API
- Google Cloud Firestore database with complete book management
- External book data fetching (OpenLibrary API)
- Comprehensive validation with Zod
- Error handling and logging

### Frontend Features

- Service Worker for caching assets and offline functionality
- Responsive design with modern CSS architecture
- CSS-based book cover placeholders with gradients
- Magpie branding with horizontally-flipped logo
- Modern favicon and PWA icons
- Toast notifications with branded icons

### API Endpoints

- GET /api/health - Health check
- GET /api/books - Get all books with filtering, sorting, pagination
- GET /api/books/:isbn - Get book by ISBN
- POST /api/books - Create new book
- PUT /api/books/:isbn - Update book
- DELETE /api/books/:isbn - Delete book
- GET /api/search?q=query - Search books
- GET /api/external/:isbn - Fetch external book data
- PUT /api/books/:isbn/favourite - Toggle favorite
- PUT /api/books/:isbn/loan - Update loan status

### Development

- Development server running on http://localhost:3000
- API accessible at http://localhost:3000/api
- Auto-reload with ts-node-dev
- TypeScript compilation working
- All dependencies installed
- Windows setup script available: `.\scripts\setup-windows.ps1`
- CSS organized into modular files (main.css, components.css, books.css, forms.css)
- PWA assets properly configured with service worker caching

### Deployment & CI/CD

- GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD automation
- Development environment: Deploy to Google Cloud development project
- Production environment: Deploy to Google Cloud production project
- Cloud Run for backend API hosting
- Firebase Hosting for PWA frontend
- Firestore databases for both development and production environments
- Automated testing, building, and deployment
- Environment protection rules for production deployments
- Service account authentication and secret management

### Google Cloud Platform Setup

- **Development Project**: Configured with dedicated GCP project
  - Firestore Database: Development environment database
  - Service Accounts: Backend, GitHub Actions, and Firebase Admin service accounts
  - Cloud Run Service: Backend API deployment

- **Production Project**: Configured with dedicated GCP project
  - Firestore Database: Production environment database
  - Service Accounts: Backend, GitHub Actions, and Firebase Admin service accounts
  - Cloud Run Service: Backend API deployment

### GitHub Workflows

- **CI Pipeline**: Automated testing and validation on pull requests
- **Development Deployment**: Triggered on `develop` branch pushes
- **Production Deployment**: Triggered on `main` branch pushes with approval gates
- **Security**: Service account key authentication with proper IAM roles

The project is ready for development and production deployment with full CI/CD automation!
